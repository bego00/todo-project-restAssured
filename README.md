# Todo Project using RestAssured

This is a repository for a Todo Project implemented using the RestAssured framework. The project aims to provide a RESTful API for managing todo items.

## Features

The Todo Project offers the following features:

1. **Create Todo**: Users can create new todo items by sending a POST request to the `/todos` endpoint. The request should include the necessary information such as the title and description of the todo item.

2. **Retrieve Todo**: Users can retrieve a specific todo item by sending a GET request to the `/todos/{id}` endpoint, where `{id}` is the unique identifier of the todo item.

3. **Update Todo**: Users can update an existing todo item by sending a PUT request to the `/todos/{id}` endpoint, providing the updated information for the todo item.

4. **Delete Todo**: Users can delete a todo item by sending a DELETE request to the `/todos/{id}` endpoint, where `{id}` is the unique identifier of the todo item.

5. **List Todos**: Users can retrieve a list of all todo items by sending a GET request to the `/todos` endpoint. This will return an array of all the existing todo items.

## Architecture 


### Let's explain the purpose of each directory and file within this architecture:


**TodoAPI.java:** This file contains the implementation of API methods for interacting with the Todo functionality, such as creating, updating, deleting, or retrieving todo items.
src/test/java/com/qacart/models: This directory contains model classes.

**Todo.java:** This file defines the Todo model class, representing the structure and attributes of a todo item.
src/test/java/com/qacart/data: This directory contains data-related classes.

**TestData.java:** This file contains test data or test data generation methods for use in test cases.
src/test/java/com/qacart/steps: This directory contains step definitions or actions related to the tests.

**TodoSteps.java:** This file contains the step definitions or methods that define the actions to perform during the test execution, such as calling API methods and validating responses.
src/test/java/com/qacart/todo: This directory contains the actual test classes.

**TodoTest.java:** This file contains the test cases for the Todo functionality, where the step definitions from TodoSteps.java are utilized to define the test flow and assertions.
pom.xml: This file is the Maven Project Object Model (POM) file. It defines the project dependencies, build configuration, and other project-related settings.

## Framework Used: RestAssured

The project is built using the RestAssured framework, which is a Java-based domain-specific language (DSL) for testing and validating RESTful APIs. RestAssured provides a simple and intuitive syntax for making HTTP requests, validating responses, and extracting data from JSON or XML responses.

RestAssured offers several key features that make it suitable for API testing and automation:

- **Fluent API**: RestAssured provides a fluent and expressive API for constructing HTTP requests, making it easy to set headers, query parameters, request bodies, and other request details.

- **Request Specification**: With RestAssured, you can define a base request specification that can be reused across multiple test cases, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

- **Response Validation**: RestAssured offers powerful response validation capabilities, allowing you to verify response status codes, headers, and the structure of the response body using various assertions.

- **Support for JSON and XML**: RestAssured provides built-in support for handling JSON and XML payloads, making it convenient to work with API responses in these formats.

- **Test Framework Integration**: RestAssured seamlessly integrates with popular test frameworks such as JUnit and TestNG, enabling you to incorporate API testing into your existing test suites.

- **Extensibility**: RestAssured allows you to extend its functionality by implementing custom request filters, response filters, and other extensions, enabling advanced scenarios and customization.

For more information on RestAssured and its features, please refer to the official documentation: [RestAssured Documentation](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Todo Project using RestAssured, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bego00/todo-project-restAssured.git
   ```

2. Set up the necessary dependencies and environment (refer to project-specific documentation).

3. Build and run the project.

4. Start testing the API endpoints using RestAssured.

## Conclusion

The Todo Project implemented using RestAssured provides a robust and efficient way to manage todo items through a RESTful API. With its intuitive API and comprehensive features, RestAssured simplifies the process of testing and validating API endpoints. Feel free to explore the code in this repository and adapt it to your own project requirements.
